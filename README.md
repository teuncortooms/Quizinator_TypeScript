# Quizinator for Google Sheets

This Google Apps project lets myself and colleagues in the English department create quizzes based on data in an existing spreadsheet.

It works and it's in use. But I still use it to practice new skills and insights.

Git only backs up the latest dev version, one branch. Version control is done via CLASP in Google Apps Script.

Recently I've started converting my spaghetti code to TypeScript classes. My first goal is to get it to work again, leaving in sub-
optimal code (like extensive use of type _any_) to be dealt with later. Also, next on the list is implementing a front-end framework (like Vue) to clean up front-end, and while on that, get all html out of back-end.
